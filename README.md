# Carbon eMission
Track and reduce your carbon footprint with ease. Input your data, get instant results, and compete on the leaderboard to become the most eco-friendly user. Join the movement for a greener world!

## Inspiration
The Carbon eMissionary is a prototype carbon footprint tracker that's been the result of our inspiration to encourage more individuals to take accountability for their impact on the environment as the ongoing concerns of climate change continue to rise. In doing so, we wanted to provide an easy way of tracking and reducing one's carbon footprint, while making it accessible to everyone!

## What it does
Carbon eMissionary allows users to input data related to their daily activities, such as transportation, energy usage, and food consumption. Then, the tool calculates their carbon footprint and displays the results. Moreover, a leaderboard has been implemented to motivate users to lower their carbon footprint by showcasing the top eco-friendly participants.

## How we built it
We built Carbon eMissionary using a full-stack approach with modern technologies:

- Frontend: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Backend: Express.js RESTful API with modular architecture
- Database: PostgreSQL (NeonDB) for storing user data and environmental metric entries
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication with cookie management and bcrypt password hashing
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for generating personalized environmental insights
- Data Visualization: Custom components for displaying metrics and leaderboards
- API Design: RESTful endpoints for user authentication, data submission, and retrieving insights
- Secure Communication: CORS implementation for secure cross-origin requests
